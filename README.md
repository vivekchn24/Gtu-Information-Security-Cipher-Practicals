## 🧪 Practicals Covered

### 1. ✅ Caesar Cipher
- **Type:** Substitution Cipher
- **Logic:** Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
- **Features:**
  - User-defined shift value
  - Handles both encryption and decryption
  - Preserves case sensitivity

### 2. ✅ Monoalphabetic Cipher
- **Type:** Substitution Cipher
- **Logic:** Each letter of the plaintext is mapped to a different letter in the alphabet using a fixed key.
- **Features:**
  - Custom key mapping
  - Encrypts input based on one-to-one substitution
  - Basic validation for alphabet-only strings
